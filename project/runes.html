<h1>Runes, Rune Pages, etc.</h1>

	Runes are very important in league, they can singlehandedly decide the outcome of a fight. To a new player they're one of the biggest hurdles to the gamesMainly cause its importance can be underplayed, and understanding all of isnt easy.
	<p> Runes are split up into 5  Paths, Precision, Domination, Sorcery, Resolve, and Inspiration. When selecting your runes you're given 2 Trees, your first is your Main Tree, and Your second is your Secondary Tree (Shocker). For your main tree you get to select 1 Keystone that comes with the path you selected, and 3 slots that come with that path, for your secondary Tree you can select to slots from a path to have. Some of these terms may be confusing stick with me.
	this is the paths, keystone, and slots in a rune page:</p>
