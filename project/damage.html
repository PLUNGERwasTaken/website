<h5><i>By Jackson Curtis</i></h5>

<p>	In League Damage is extremly important League is often split up to three types:
<ul>
	<li>Attack Damage</li>
	<li>Ability Damage</li>
	<li>True Damage</li>
</ul>
Although there aren't lined out definitions of the three they're consistant enough you cna give them definitons. Attack damage is a stat that can apply to some abilites (common on Tanks) and will increase your auto attack damge, Ability Damage (also called Ability Power) is a stat only meant to increase damage for abilities (very common on mana champs). While Attack Damage's resistance is Armor, and Ability Power's Resistance is Magic Resist, True Damage has no Resistance (hence true) True damage isnt very common, and only found on some champions or <b>executions.</b>
	Executions will instantly kill an enemy once theyre past a certain health. Excutions can be found on Pyke, Draven, Ziggs, Urgot, and the Item Collectors.
