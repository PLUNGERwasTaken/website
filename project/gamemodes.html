<h1>Gamemodes</h1>
League of Legends has a few Gamemodes, sadly there were more long before but where sunset due too multiple reasons. Eitherway In league theres two (kinda 4 depending on what you count) and a few subtypes.
If you were to right now open the league luancher hit play you'd see at least three forms of play, <a href="https://plungerwastaken.github.io/website/project/summoners_rift.html">Summoners Rift </a>, ARAM (All Random All Mid), TFT (Team Fight Tactics), and depending on the season there may be another- these are called <a href="https://plungerwastaken.github.io/website/project/RGM.html"> Rotating Game Mode</a>.

	Summoners rift is the standard way of playing league, Summoners rift is breken up into a few modes.
	<ol type="i">
	<li> Blind Pick</li>
	<li> Draft Pick</li>
	<li> Ranked Solo/ Duo</li>
	<li> Ranked Flex </li>
	</ol>
	Blind pick is the starting way of playing, if you're a new account thiswill be the only way to play Summoners Rift. Blind Pick works by everyone can play everyone essentially, there can be two of the same champion. During Champion select in the bottom left there is a chat bar you'll want to declare your role (Look into our <a href="https://plungerwastaken.github.io/website/project/roles.html">Roles page</a> for more information). 
	Draft Pick is a more secfisticated version of Blind. Draft has a pick and ban system, this will be explained later. Before you queue for a match you must select a <a href="https://plungerwastaken.github.io/website/project/roles.html">Role</a> theres two role slots Primarary and Secondary, Primarary is meant for the Role you want to play, secondarary acts as a backup, there is small chance you can gets called autofilled, this is very very very rare so don't worry. Every summoner (a summoner is you, teamates, and enemies) bans one champ, when a champ is banned no one can play them. after everyone has banned a Champion, then the select process begins, Ideally you get assigned the role you selected as your primarary.
