<h1>Introduction to Summoner's Rift</h1>
<h2><i><b>By Jackson Curtis</b></i></h2>


<p>	Summoner's Rift is the standard form of playing League, Summoner's rift consist of 3 Lanes Top, Middle, and Bottom. And a space inbetween called the jungle and a diagonal area connect the lanes centers called the river. <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Map_of_MOBA.svg/800px-Map_of_MOBA.svg.png" alt="Summoners Rift Map"></p></p>


<p> 	In Summoner's Rift each lane has one or more player/role in it, visit our Role page on roles. Top Lane has a Top Laner, Jungle has a Jungler, Mid-lane hs a Midlaner, Bot Lane usally has a whats called a ADC (Attack Damage Carry) and a Support.
 	In Summoner's Rift your objective is to destroy the enemys Nexus, each Nexus is defended by Towers, down a lane (From Nexus to the end of a lane) will have 1 inhibitor 2 Back Towers and 1 Front tower.
Each lane has whats called a tower, towers will shoot projectiles once an enemy is in a certin radius (only once at a time). On both teams a lane will have a Front Tower, Front towers have more maximum Health, pre-5 minutes shielding, and Tower plating.
	Tower Plating is a reward of doing large amounts of damage to towers early game. Essentially a Front Tower's health into 5 segmets with 1000 health inbetween each segment, the catch is the tower gains more dmg resistance each plate.Platings will fall after 14 minutes into a match (meaning the reward for each plate and damge resistance is gone, not the tower as a whole).
	<div>note: If you deal damage to a enemy and your under the enemys tower range it will immeditly target you.

	The last things to note about Summoners rift is Objectives, and Jungle Camps. Objectives are points of intrest that both teams try to score by killing th objective, in the top side there is Rift Herald commonly named Shelly, Rift herald can be killed alltheway to 19:55 where by then Shelly is killed for Baron. When shelly is killed by player shelly will drop a Eye of the Herald, a consumeable where once consumed will fight temporarily for the summoning side. Shelly will do massive amount of damage to towers at the cost of its own health. Shelly can easily killed whever an eye spawns on the back this will do large amounts of damge to shelly when attacked. 
	the next objective on the top side of jungle is Baron Nashor, when killed whatever the killer teamn is on, the entire team gets faster recalls, and when neer minions will buff them. 
	The other set of Objectives is on the other side of map, in the drake pit. There are 7 types of drakes (2 of which are in development and will be released in season 12) these are the following drakes:
	<dl>
